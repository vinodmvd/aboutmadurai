          <h2> Immayilum Nanmai Tharuvar Temple </h2>
          <p>
          This temple is believed to be built before Meenakshi Amman temple. THe history of this temple is that
          before one rules a kingdom, they need to do a puja to Lord Shiva. After meenakshi rules madurai for
          three months, she asked shiva, her console to rule Madurai for the next three months. So Lord Shiva
          himself did puja on a Shivalinga facing westward, which means Meenakshi and Sundareswarar are behind
          Shivalinga. So that devotees can have rear side dharsan. People who request pardoning for their sins
          can achive goodness at the same time, defines the name of the temple.
